                    <h3>FMEA and Atmospheric Data Collection for NMI</h3>
                    <p>For our client NMI, based in Makeni, we conducted a detailed Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) alongside atmospheric data collection. This project was essential for identifying potential hazards and assessing the environmental impact in the region. Our analysis provided actionable insights to help NMI optimize their safety protocols and adhere to environmental standards.</p>
